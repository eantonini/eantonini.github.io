I am a Senior Energy System Modeller at [Open Energy Transition](https://openenergytransition.org/). I conduct research, perform analyses, and develop open-source tools and methodologies to enable future net-zero-emissions energy systems. My work focuses on facilitating the large-scale integration of renewable energy generation into these systems, identifying geophysical constraints and unintended consequences of deploying these systems at scale, and advancing a climate-resilient energy transition.

My skills include deep expertise in low-carbon energy technologies, energy systems optimization, and decarbonization strategies. I have a strong foundation in computational techniques, including mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, and data visualization. Additionally, I bring significant experience in project management, interdisciplinary collaboration, and mentoring, along with excellent communication skills for writing reports, publishing research, and delivering presentations at international conferences.

I hold a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from the [University of Padua](https://www.unipd.it/) and a PhD in Mechanical and Industrial Engineering from the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/).
