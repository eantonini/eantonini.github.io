I am a Scientist at the [CMCC Foundation - Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change](https://www.cmcc.it) in Milan, Italy. My research aims to facilitate large-scale integration of renewable energy generation in future net-zero emissions energy systems, identify geophysical constraints and unintended consequences if deployed at scale, and enable a climate-resilient energy transition.

Over the past ten years, I have been conducting research in energy systems, wind energy, computational fluid dynamics and optimization algorithms with the goal of advancing the knowledge of wind turbine aerodynamics, creating new design frameworks for the wind turbine industry, understanding the physics of large-scale wind power extraction, and resolving system integration challenges for large-scale expansion of low-carbon technologies in decarbonized electricity systems.

My skills encompass a deep expertise in low-carbon energy technologies, energy systems optimization, and decarbonization strategies, with a strong foundation in computational techniques such as mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, and data visualization. Additionally, I possess significant experience in project management, interdisciplinary collaboration, and mentoring, coupled with excellent communication abilities for writing reports, publishing research, and delivering presentations at international conferences.

I hold a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from the [University of Padua](https://www.unipd.it/) and a PhD in Mechanical and Industrial Engineering from the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/).
