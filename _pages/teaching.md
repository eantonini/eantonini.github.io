## GUEST LECTURER FOR:

[Wind Power](https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/programs/graduate/courses/) – Graduate course at the University of Toronto, Fall 2018

I presented the principles of fluid mechanics of wind farms with emphasis on wakes and their interaction with the atmospheric boundary layer. I developed basic concepts in a seminar-style presentation and used real wind farm examples to reinforce these concepts.

## GUEST SPEAKER FOR:

[Summer STARS](https://case.carnegiescience.edu/student-programs/summer-stars/) – Carnegie Academy for Science Education (CASE), July 2021

CASE’s Summer STARS is a summer internship program for high school students where they work on a mini-research project, exploring STEM careers, and completing an oral presentation to peer researchers, teachers, parents, and school administrators. I was invited to speak about my research at Carnegie and career paths and opportunities in STEM fields.

## TEACHING ASSISTANT FOR:

[Fluid Mechanics I](https://engineering.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/mie312h1) – Undergraduate course at the University of Toronto, Fall 2016

I led a lab experiment regarding head losses in pipes and fittings, taught students the relevant material, and showed them how to conduct measurements. The students were asked to collect measurements with piezometers and flowmeters of different pipes configurations and write a report illustrating theoretical calculations and experimental measurements of pressure losses in pipes systems. I marked students’ lab reports as well as exams.

[Thermal Energy Conversion](https://engineering.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/mie311h1) – Undergraduate course at the University of Toronto, Winter 2018

I conducted a lab experiment regarding the performance of a two-stage air compressor with intercooling driven by a steam engine. Before the experiment, I taught students the relevant material and showed them how to conduct measurements. The students had to collect measurements of pressures, temperatures, and mass flow rate at different points along the compressor stages, calculate the respective thermodynamics states and efficiencies, and ultimately provide a report. I marked students’ lab reports as well as assignments.

[Alternative Energy Systems](https://engineering.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/mie515h1) – Graduate course at the University of Toronto, Fall 2016 and Fall 2017

I marked students’ assignments that included problem sets and reports of simulations results. I designed marking schemes, provided students with detailed feedback, and showed assignments solution.

[Wind Power](https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/programs/graduate/courses/) – Graduate course at the University of Toronto, Fall 2017 and Fall 2018

I designed and marked students’ assignments that included three problem sets. I designed and improved the problems of each assignment with respect to previous years, designed marking schemes, provided students with detailed feedback, and showed assignments solution.
