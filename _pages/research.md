## Geophysical constraints on global and regional wind power (2019-2022)

<img src='/images/Physics-of-large-wind-farms-1024x576.png'>

This research project aimed at understanding the physics of wind power extraction for regional-scale wind farms, which physical parameters control their power extraction, and, more generally, the availability and reliability of wind power. The geophysical limit to maximum power density of large wind farms (regional scale) is related to the rate of replenishment of kinetic energy removed from the atmosphere by wind turbines. By means of both numerical atmospheric simulations and analytic expressions, I unmasked how atmospheric pressure gradients and the latitude-dependent Coriolis parameter control the power density of large-scale wind farms ([Antonini et al. 2021a](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.116048)). I also identified the length scale at which a wind farm reaches its generation limits. This analysis provides a better understanding and a physical explanation to the scalability of wind farms and defines spatial constraints in large scale expansion of wind power plants ([Antonini et al. 2021b](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2103875118)). Lastly, I identified reliable locations for wind power generation through a global analysis of wind droughts ([Antonini et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-024-01260-7)).

## Optimizing wind farm layouts using computational fluid dynamical models and adjoint methods (2014-2019)

During my PhD program, I conducted research on computational modeling and design optimization of wind farms. My contributions have furthered accurate modeling of wake effects in wind farms and CFD-based layout optimization. I analyzed the effect of turbulence modeling on CFD simulations of wind turbine wakes and provided useful insights and recommendations for their use ([Antonini et al. 2016](https://doi.org/10.1115/IMECE2016-67353), [2018a](https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4039377)). Moreover, I revealed the contribution of wind direction uncertainty to the discrepancies usually found between CFD predictions of wake wind speed and field measurements ([Antonini et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2018.10.084)). To optimize wind farm layouts and integrate CFD models in a design methodology, I developed and implemented an innovative adjoint method for gradient calculations within the framework of a gradient-based optimization ([Antonini et al. 2018b](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.07.076)). The developed optimization methodology integrated CFD models and overcame the high computational costs of a CFD-based optimization. This unique methodology enabled for the first time the optimization of wind farms in complex terrains with realistic ambient conditions and flow structures ([Antonini et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114426)).

## Numerical modelling of wind turbine aerodynamics (2013-2014)

During my MSc program, I was engaged in computational modeling of both horizontal and vertical axis wind turbines. Their design methods are usually based on blade element-momentum theory, which in turn relies on the accuracy of the chosen airfoilsâ€™aerodynamic database. To assess their accuracy, I reviewed and compared four widely used aerodynamic coefficient databases for vertical axis wind turbine simulations and provided practical guidance to wind turbine designers for different rotor sizes and working conditions ([Bedon at al. 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2014.07.126)). I also developed models based on vortex theory to analyze the rotor performance of these machines and establish new and reliable design procedures. An innovative vortex model that I proposed was used to simulate the complex dynamic stall behavior of turbine blades and provided excellent agreement with experimental data at a reduced computational cost ([Antonini et al. 2015](https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053430)).
